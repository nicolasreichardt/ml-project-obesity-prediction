#### Data Sources

**Obesity Prediction Dataset**: We will use the Obesity Levels Estimation Dataset. This dataset is designed for estimating obesity levels in individuals from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia based on their eating habits and physical condition. It contains 17 attributes and a total of 2,111 records. Each record is labeled with the class variable “NObesity” (Obesity Level), which categorizes individuals into seven obesity-related classifications: Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II, and Obesity Type III.
The dataset can be retrieved from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchikakumbhar/obesity-prediction) and the paper [here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6710633/).
