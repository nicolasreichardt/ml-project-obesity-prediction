    "#### Summary \n",
    "When comparing regular logistic regression and ridge logistic regression on the obesity classification task, we find that ridge achieves a higher test accuracy (93.6% vs 92.2%) and stronger performance across nearly all classes. This improvement stems from ridge's use of L2 regularization, which penalizes overly large coefficients and mitigates overfitting. This is especially important in high-dimensional settings with many one-hot encoded categorical features. Notably, class-level F1 scores improved in categories like \"Normal_Weight\" and both \"Overweight_Level\" classes, suggesting that ridge helped the model better distinguish between closely related classes. Overall, ridge logistic regression offers more robust generalization and smoother class boundaries in this multi-class classification context. \n"
